Plane tickets
Design and deploy a client-server application for flight ticket management. The customer can choose their destination and then the date of departure and return. The application will have two types of users (buyer and administrator).
The buyer will be able to do the following:
- In-app registration.
  - Select a destination
  - Add to cart.
  - Place the order
The administrator of the application can perform the following operations:
  - CRUD users.
- CRUD tickets.
- CRUD Destinations.

The application will be web (Spring).
